# python-api-challenge

Hello and welcome to my Python Api Challenge! 

I want to start off by saying I had so many techincal issues with this assignment, it took 6 weeks for my API key to work, I went through 2 failed tutor attempts to try to fix issues that ended up just being typos. It was a doozey, but I did it! 

In my files you will find both notebooks for WeatherPy and VacationPy, I used the starter code to get started then all code was written by me using class materials and troubleshooting with the classes AI tool. In my Output Data sub-folder you will find all of my PNG's for all plots made for WeatherPy and the cities.csv that was generated in my search.

Please let me know if you run into any issues grading my assignment. Thank you!

Update made on 3/24/2025 - updated discussion langauge about linear relationship to include more r-value based statements.
